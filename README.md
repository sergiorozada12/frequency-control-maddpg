# Deep Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Cost-Efficient Distributed Load Frequency Control

This repository contains the code of the paper 
*Deep Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Cost Efficient Distributed 
Load Frequency Control*. The repository is distributed as follows:
* **dynamics.py**: contains the dynamics of the power system.
* **rl.py**: contains RL ancillary functions to train the models.
* **architecture.py**: contains the network architectures used.
* **training files**: all files starting by **train_** contains all the RL experiments.
* **test files**: all files starting by **test_** contains all the tests and figures.
* **other methods**: baseline methods can be found in **distributed_optimal_control.py**
  , and **distributed_optimal_control_network.py**.
